Unofficial WiringPi Mirror
==========================

This is an unofficial mirror of WiringPi to support ports (Python/Ruby/etc).  With the
[end of official development](http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/), this repository
has become a mirror of the last "official" source release as well as a source for small
updates to support newer hardware (primarily for use by the ports).

  * The final "official" source release can be found at the
    [`final_source_2.50`](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/tree/final_official_2.50) tag.
  * The default `master` branch contains code that has been written since that final source
    release to provide support for newer hardware.

The code was fetched from [this github](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi).
